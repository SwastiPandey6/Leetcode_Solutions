# Leetcode Solutions 🧠

This repository tracks my daily LeetCode practice.  
Problems are organized by difficulty level: **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard**.

Each folder contains solutions written in Python/Java/C++ (depending on what I use).  
I’m maintaining this repo to stay consistent, track progress, and improve problem-solving skills 💪.
